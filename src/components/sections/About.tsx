          I am a Front-End Developer who transforms digital strategies into impactful experiences,
          blending technical elegance with strategic vision rooted in marketing and UX. My mission
          is simple: craft interfaces that captivate visually and deliver tangible business
          outcomes.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-4">
          My professional path is unconventional yet powerful. Transitioning from digital marketing
          to web development taught me that efficient code is most impactful when aligned with
          real-world business goals. Today I combine React, Next.js, and TypeScript with strong
          analytics to ship solutions that boost conversions, optimize performance, and deliver
          measurable value.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-4">
          My competitive edge is the rare intersection of technical skill and strategic thinking. I
          build high-performance interfaces, but what truly sets me apart is a deep understanding of
          user behavior and commercial objectives - every project targets more than code; it targets
          meaningful business impact.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-4">
          I am a firm believer in continuous learning and open collaboration. My self-driven
          education, strengthened by Harvard CS50 course CS50 course and active participation in
          global developer communities, keeps me ahead of the curve.
