          I'm a Front-End Developer who transforms digital strategies into impactful experiences,
          blending technical elegance with strategic vision rooted in marketing and UX. My mission
          is simple: craft interfaces that captivate visually and deliver tangible business
          outcomes.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-4">
          My professional path is unconventional yet powerful: transitioning from digital marketing
          to web development taught me that efficient code is most impactful when aligned with
          real-world business goals. Today, I leverage React, Next.js, and TypeScript alongside my
          analytical skills to build solutions that boost conversions, optimize performance, and
          generate measurable value.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-4">
          My competitive edge is the rare intersection of technical skill and strategic thinking. I
          build high-performance interfaces, but what truly sets me apart is my deep understanding
          of user behavior and commercial objectives â€” ensuring each project delivers more than
          code; it delivers genuine business impact.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-4">
          I'm a passionate believer in continuous learning and open collaboration. My self-driven
          education, enhanced by Harvard's CS50 course and active participation in global developer
          communities, ensures that I remain at the forefront of technology and innovation.
        </p>

          translate it into strategic success, let's connect and explore how I can help your
